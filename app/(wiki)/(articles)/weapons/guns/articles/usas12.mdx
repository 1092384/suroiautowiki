The USAS-12 is an explosive weapon that was first available during the Halloween 2023 event.

# Strategy

The USAS-12 can be very powerful in mid-range combat due its high DPS and explosive rounds. However, it does not fare well in long-range combat as it is easily outranged by other weapons.

- Both the explosion and shrapnel have a high obstacle multiplier, allowing you to easily destroy cover such as trees or even rocks.
- Be careful not to accidentally damage yourself when using the USAS-12 at close range.
- The USAS-12 has a slow bullet speed so you will need to lead your shots when firing at moving targets.

# Events
