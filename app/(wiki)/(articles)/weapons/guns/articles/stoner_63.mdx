The Stoner 63 is a powerful 5.56mm LMG. It has a large magazine capacity and can easily shred through obstacles thanks
to its 2x obstacle damage multiplier. However, it is balanced with a long reload time.

# Tips

- The Stoner 63 chews through ammo if you're not careful. Make sure to pick up ammo and avoid wasting shots.
- Due to its high obstacle multiplier and good DPS, the Stoner 63 is great weapon for destroying obstacles. Use it to clear out enemy cover.
- Make sure to take cover while reloading as this gun has a long reload time.
  - Conversely, if you see an enemy reloading, take advantage of their vulnerability by rushing them with a shotgun or other high DPS weapon.
- Due to its long barrel this weapon is ineffective at short range. Use this to your advantage if you are countering a Stoner 63 user.
  - Likewise, shotguns and other CQC weapons can easily counter this weapon at close range.
  - Therefore it is useful to pair this weapon with a short range weapon (e.g., a <Link href="/weapons/guns/flues">Flues</Link> or <Link href="/weapons/guns/model_37">Model 37</Link>) to cover its weakness at close range.
  - Remember, the Stoner 63 is deadly at range so try to stay close to cover and avoid open areas if countering
